# Graph Visualizer

Graph Visualizer is a web application built with React and TypeScript that allows users to visualize graphs and perform various operations such as adding vertices, adding edges, removing objects, running algorithms like Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Dijkstra's algorithm, and finding the Minimum Spanning Tree.

## Features

- Add Vertex: Allows users to add vertices to the graph.
- Add Edge: Enables users to add edges between vertices.
- Remove Object: Allows users to remove vertices or edges from the graph.
- Run an Algorithm: Provides options to run various graph algorithms.
  - Breadth First Search (BFS): Traverses the graph in breadth-first order.
  - Depth First Search (DFS): Traverses the graph in depth-first order.
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices.
  - Minimum Spanning Tree: Finds the minimum spanning tree of the graph.
- Clear: Clears the graph and resets it to its initial state.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Graph_Visualizer
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

- Once the application is running, you can interact with the graph using the provided options.
- Use the buttons to add vertices, add edges, remove objects, run algorithms, and clear the graph.

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- React-Konva (for canvas drawing)
